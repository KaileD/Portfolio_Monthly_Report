# Portfolio_Monthly_Report

This is a handy program I built during my internship at a private equity. It downloads stock price data from Yahoo Finance and yields a monthly report for our portfolio.

The design per se is not beautiful (which is actually ugly), but it does the job so I didn't bother to optimize it.
